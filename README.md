# Potato Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the code and resources for detecting diseases in potato plants using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction

Potato is one of the most important crops worldwide, but it is susceptible to various diseases that can significantly reduce yield and quality. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for effective management and control. Deep learning offers a promising approach for automating disease detection tasks by analyzing images of infected plants.

## Dataset

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swastik2004/potato-leaf-diseases) used for training and evaluation consists of images of healthy potato plants and plants infected with various diseases, such as late blight, early blight, and bacterial wilt. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure proper evaluation of the model's performance.

## Model Architecture

The deep learning model employed for disease detection in potato plants is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, a pretrained CNN model such as ResNet,vgg-16,vgg-19,inceptionV3 is fine-tuned on the potato disease dataset to leverage transfer learning and improve performance.

## Training

The training process involves loading the dataset, preprocessing images, initializing the pretrained CNN model, fine-tuning the model on the potato disease dataset, and optimizing model parameters using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization. Training progress is monitored using metrics such as loss and accuracy.

## Evaluation

After training the model, it is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance in detecting potato diseases. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to measure the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between healthy and diseased plants.

## Deployment

Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed in practical applications for real-time disease detection in potato fields. Deployment may involve integrating the model into a web or mobile application, along with appropriate user interfaces for capturing and analyzing images of potato plants.
